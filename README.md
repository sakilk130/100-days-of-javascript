# 100 Days Of JavaScript

This is a collection of 100 days of JavaScript projects. Each day I will create a new project using vanilla JavaScript. The projects will be simple and easy to understand. I will also add a README.md file to each project with a description of the project and how to run it.

## Day 1 - Counter App

This is a simple counter app using vanilla JavaScript.

## Day 2 - Random Hex Color Generator

This is a simple random hex color generator. It generates a random hex color and displays it on the screen. It also displays the hex color code.
